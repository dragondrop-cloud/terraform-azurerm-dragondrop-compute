## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own Azure cloud environment.

It defines an [Azure Container App](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/container-instance-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned Azure Container Instance.

The url for this Azure Container App is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url". All environment variables that need to be configured are secrets on the Azure Container Instance.

The Azure Container Instance hosts dragondrop's container.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates a new role, "dragondrop-container-instance-update" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke
the created Azure Container Instance. This role is given to a new user-assigned identity, "dragondrop-container-app".
