## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own Azure cloud environment.

It defines a [Azure Function](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/azure-container-instance-https-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned Azure Container Instance.

The url for this Azure Function is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url".

The Azure Container Instance hosts dragondrop's proprietary container. All environment variables that need to be configured are references
to secrets within Azure Key Vault, and can be customized like any other secret.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates a new IAM role, "dragondrop HTTPS Trigger Role" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke
the created Azure Container Instance. This role is assigned to a new service account, and that service account is the service account
used by the Azure Function.

Lastly, another service account is granted Secret Accessor privileges on only the secrets referenced by the Azure Container Instance as
environment variables.
